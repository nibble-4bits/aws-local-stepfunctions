## Events

Execution events are represented as plain objects, and all of them share two common fields:

- `type`: A string that indicates the type of the event being produced.
- `timestamp`: The Unix timestamp in milliseconds, representing the time at which the event was produced.

In turn, each type of event may contain additional fields containing supplementary data associated with the event.

## Types of events

### `ExecutionStarted` event

The `ExecutionStarted` event is produced when the execution is started.

#### Additional fields

- `input`: Input value passed to the execution.

#### Example

```js
{
    type: 'ExecutionStarted',
    timestamp: 1234567890123,
    input: { id: 5, coordX: '12.638614', coordY: '-36.581396' }
}
```

---

### `ExecutionSucceeded` event

The `ExecutionSucceeded` event is produced when the execution ends successfully.

#### Additional fields

- `output`: Output value produced by the execution.

#### Example

```js
{
    type: 'ExecutionSucceeded',
    timestamp: 1234567890123,
    output: [55, 99, 22]
}
```

---

### `ExecutionFailed` event

The `ExecutionFailed` event is produced when the execution encounters an error and fails.

#### Additional fields

- `Error`: Name of the error that caused the failure.
- `Cause`: This field can either be a string or an object:
  - `string`: Contains a description explaining why the execution failed.
  - `object`: Contains details that provide more information as to why the execution failed.

#### Example

```js
{
    type: 'ExecutionFailed',
    timestamp: 1234567890123,
    Error: 'TypeError',
    Cause: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')"

---

### `ExecutionAborted` event
