## Events

Execution events are represented as plain objects, and all of them share two common fields:

- `type`: A string that indicates the type of the event being produced.
- `timestamp`: The Unix timestamp in milliseconds, representing the time at which the event was produced.

In turn, each type of event may contain additional fields containing supplementary data associated with the event.

## Types of events

### `ExecutionStarted` event

The `ExecutionStarted` event is produced when the execution is started.

#### Additional fields

- `input`: Input value passed to the execution.

#### Example

```js
{
    type: 'ExecutionStarted',
    timestamp: 1234567890123,
    input: { id: 5, coordX: '12.638614', coordY: '-36.581396' }
}
```

---

### `ExecutionSucceeded` event

The `ExecutionSucceeded` event is produced when the execution ends successfully.

#### Additional fields

- `output`: Output value produced by the execution.

#### Example

```js
{
    type: 'ExecutionSucceeded',
    timestamp: 1234567890123,
    output: [55, 99, 22]
}
```

---

### `ExecutionFailed` event

The `ExecutionFailed` event is produced when the execution encounters an error and fails.

#### Additional fields

- `Error`: Name of the error that caused the failure.
- `Cause`: A human-readable description explaining why the execution failed.

#### Example

```js
{
    type: 'ExecutionFailed',
    timestamp: 1234567890123,
    Error: 'TypeError',
    Cause: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')"
}
```

---

### `ExecutionAborted` event

The `ExecutionAborted` event is produced when the execution is aborted by calling the `abort` function returned by the [`StateMachine.run`](/README.md#statemachineruninput-options) method.

#### Additional fields

None.

#### Example

```js
{
    type: 'ExecutionAborted',
    timestamp: 1234567890123
}
```

---

### `ExecutionTimeout` event

The `ExecutionTimeout` event is produced when the execution times out because the execution ran longer than the number of seconds specified in the [`TimeoutSeconds` top-level field](https://states-language.net/#toplevelfields).

#### Additional fields

None.

#### Example

```js
{
    type: 'ExecutionTimeout',
    timestamp: 1234567890123
}
```

---

### `MapIterationStarted` event

The `MapIterationStarted` event is produced when an iteration in a `Map` state has started.

#### Additional fields
